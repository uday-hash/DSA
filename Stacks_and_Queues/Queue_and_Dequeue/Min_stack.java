/*
 * Problem Description

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieve the minimum element in constant time.
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
NOTE:
All the operations have to be constant time operations.
getMin() should return -1 if the stack is empty.
pop() should return nothing if the stack is empty.
top() should return -1 if the stack is empty.
Problem Constraints
