/*
 * Problem Description
You are given a matrix A of size N x 2 which represents different operations.
Assume initially you have a stack-like data structure you have to perform operations on it.

Operations are of two types:

1 x: push an integer x onto the stack and return -1.

2 0: remove and return the most frequent element in the stack.

If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

A[i][0] describes the type of operation to be performed. A[i][1] describe the element x or 0 corresponding to the operation performed.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= A[i][0] <= 2

0 <= A[i][1] <= 109
