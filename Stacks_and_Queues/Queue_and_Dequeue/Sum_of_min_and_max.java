/*
 * Problem Description
Given an array A of both positive and negative integers.

Your task is to compute the sum of minimum and maximum elements of all sub-array of size B.

NOTE: Since the answer can be very large, you are required to return the sum modulo 109 + 7.



Problem Constraints
1 <= size of array A <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109

1 <= B <= size of array
