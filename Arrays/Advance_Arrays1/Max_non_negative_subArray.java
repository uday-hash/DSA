/*
 * Given an array of integers, A of length N, find out the maximum sum sub-array of non negative numbers from A.

The sub-array should be contiguous i.e., a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.

Maximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the sub-array.

Find and return the required subarray.

NOTE:

    1. If there is a tie, then compare with segment's length and return segment which has maximum length.
    2. If there is still a tie, then return the segment with minimum starting index.


Input Format:

The first and the only argument of input contains an integer array A, of length N.
Output Format:

Return an array of integers, that is a subarray of A that satisfies the given conditions.
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 1e5
-INT_MAX < A[i] <= INT_MAX
