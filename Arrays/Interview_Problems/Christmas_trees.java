/*
 * Problem Description
You are given an array A consisting of heights of Christmas trees and an array B of the same size consisting of the cost of each of the trees (Bi is the cost of tree Ai, where 1 ≤ i ≤ size(A)), and you are supposed to choose 3 trees (let's say, indices p, q, and r), such that Ap < Aq < Ar, where p < q < r.
The cost of these trees is Bp + Bq + Br.

You are to choose 3 trees such that their total cost is minimum. Return that cost.

If it is not possible to choose 3 such trees return -1.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109
3 <= size(A) = size(B) <= 3000
