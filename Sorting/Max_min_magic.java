/*
 * Problem Description
Given an array of integers A of size N where N is even.

Divide the array into two subsets such that

1.Length of both subset is equal.
2.Each element of A occurs in exactly one of these subset.
Magic number = sum of absolute difference of corresponding elements of subset.

Note: You can reorder the position of elements within the subset to 
find the value of the magic number.
For Ex:- 
subset 1 = {1, 5, 1}, 
subset 2 = {1, 7, 11}
Magic number = abs(1 - 1) + abs(5 - 7) + abs(1 - 11) = 12
Return an array B of size 2, where B[0] = maximum possible value 
of Magic number modulo 109 + 7, B[1] = minimum possible value of a Magic 
number modulo 109 + 7.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109

N is even
