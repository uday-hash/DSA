/*
 * Problem Description
Given an one-dimensional integer array A of size N and an integer B.

Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to B.

Here a pair is defined as an integer pair (x, y), where x and y are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is B.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 104

0 <= A[i], B <= 105
