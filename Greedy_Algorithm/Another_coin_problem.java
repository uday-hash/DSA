/*
 * Problem Description
The monetary system in DarkLand is really simple and systematic. The locals-only use coins. The coins come in different values. The values used are:

 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, ...
Formally, for each K >= 0 there are coins worth 5K.

Given an integer A denoting the cost of an item, find and return the smallest number of coins necessary to pay exactly the cost of the item (assuming you have a sufficient supply of coins of each of the types you will need).

1 <= A <= 2Ã—109
