/*
 * Problem Description
There is a dictionary A of N words, and ith word has a unique weight Wi.

Another string array B of size M contains the prefixes. For every prefix B[i], 
output atmost 5 words from the dictionary A that start with the same prefix.

Output the words in decreasing order of their weight.

NOTE: If there is no word that starts with the given prefix output -1.



Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 5

1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= M <= 10000

1 <= Wi <= 106

1 <= length of any string either in A or B <= 30
