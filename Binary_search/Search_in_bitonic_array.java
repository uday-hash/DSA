/*
 * Problem Description
Given a bitonic sequence A of N distinct elements, write a program to find a given element B in the bitonic sequence in O(logN) time.

NOTE:

A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing.


Problem Constraints
3 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i], B <= 108

Given array always contain a bitonic point.

Array A always contain distinct elements.
