/*
 * Problem Description
Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. 
Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. 
There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to 
paint 1 unit of the board.

Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under 
the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot 
be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration
 where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 106
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= C[i] <= 106
