/*
 * Problem Description
Design and implement a Linked List data structure.
A node in a linked list should have the following attributes - an integer value
* and a pointer to the next node. It should support the following operations:

insert_node(position, value) - To insert the input value at the given position in the linked list.
delete_node(position) - Delete the value at the given position from the linked list.
print_ll() - Print the entire linked list, such that each element is followed by a single space.
Note:

If an input position does not satisfy the constraint, no action is required.
Each print query has to be executed in a new line.


Problem Constraints
1 <= value <= 105
1 <= position <= n where, n is the size of the linked-list.

package LinkedList;



public class Linked_list {
    public static void insert_node(int position, int value) {
        // @params position, integer
        // @params value, integer
    }

    public static void delete_node(int position) {
        // @params position, integer
    }

    public static void print_ll() {
        // Output each element followed by a space
    }
