/*
 * Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers, A and B, and an integer C, find and return the pair whose sum is closest to C and the pair has one element from each array.

More formally, find A[i] and B[j] such that abs((A[i] + B[j]) - C) has minimum value.

If there are multiple solutions find the one with minimum i and even if there are multiple values of j for the same i then return the one with minimum j.

Return an array with two elements {A[i], B[j]}.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length of both the arrays <= 100000

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109

1 <= C <= 109
