/*
 * Problem Description
Given a graph with A nodes and C weighted edges. 
Cost of constructing the graph is the sum of weights of all the edges in the graph.

Find the minimum cost of constructing the graph by selecting some given edges such that we can reach every other node from the 1st node.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109+7 as the answer can be large.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 100000
0 <= C <= 100000
1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= N
1 <= B[i][2] <= 109
