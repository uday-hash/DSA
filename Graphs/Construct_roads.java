/*
 * Problem Description
A country consist of N cities connected by N - 1 roads. 
King of that country want to construct maximum number of roads such
 that the new country formed remains bipartite country.

Bipartite country is a country, whose cities can be partitioned into
 2 sets in such a way, that for each road (u, v) that belongs to the country,
  u and v belong to different sets. Also, there should be no multiple roads between
   two cities and no self loops.

Return the maximum number of roads king can construct. Since the answer
 could be large return answer % 109 + 7.

NOTE: All cities can be visited from any city.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 105

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= N
