/*
 * Problem Description
Given three integers A, B, and C, where A represents n, B represents r,
and C represents p and p is a prime number greater than equal to n, 
find and return the value of nCr % p where nCr % p = (n! / ((n-r)! * r!)) % p.

x! means factorial of x i.e. x! = 1 * 2 * 3... * x.

NOTE: For this problem, we are considering 1 as a prime.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106
1 <= B <= A
A <= C <= 109+7
