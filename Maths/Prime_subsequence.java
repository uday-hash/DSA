/*Given an array A having N positive numbers. You have to find the number of Prime subsequences of A.

A Prime subsequence is one that has only prime numbers, for example [2, 3], [5] are the Prime subsequences where [2, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] are not.



Input Format

The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
Output Format

Return an integer X, i.e number of Prime subsequences. 
As X can be very large print X % (1000000007), here % is modulus operator.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1e3
1 <= A[i] <= 1e6 */
