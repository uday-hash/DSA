If two dice are thrown, 
what is the probability that the sum of the two dice will be a prime number?

Choose the correct answer from the following:

A) 5/36
B) 5/18
C) 5/12
D) 1/2

Ans: C

Explaination:

1. The two dice have 36 possible outcomes. 6*6=36
2. The sum of the two dice can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. There are 11 possible outcomes.
3. The sum of the two dice can be 2,3,5,7,9,11. There are 6 possible outcomes.
4. The sum of the two dice can be 5,7,11. There are 3 possible outcomes.
5. Hence, the probability of the sum of the two dice being a prime number is 3/11=5/18=5/12
6. The probability of the sum of the two dice being a prime number is 5/12. Hence, the correct answer is C.
