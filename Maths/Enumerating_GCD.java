/*
 * Problem Description
You are given a number A and a number B. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between A and B inclusive is taken (GCD(A, A+1, A+2 ... B)).
As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers A and B can be in the range of 10100.

You have to return the value of GCD found.

The greatest common divisor of 2 numbers, A and B, is the largest number, D that divides both A and B perfectly.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= B <= 10100
